Hey There! <!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>My name is Tyler K.</p>
<p>I am a Junior at ASU, studying Public Health and chasing the dream of attending medical school. In my free time I work on Software development for auotmation projects and webscraping. :)</p> <!-- ksjdokhdfgdufdfkjhfkjahdfkjhafkjhakf -->
<p>I began coding while working with software to assist in purchasing limited sneakers, which eventually ended up spiraling into a unique hobby, while showing me the ropes of how medicine and code can be united together and produce some real breakthoughs.<a href=""></a></p><!-- kjdhjhgdgldjhgdwtoiewotwotjdfkjdfffsf -->
<p>At the moment, all of this is a hobby and I enjoy working on it with my friends.<a href=""></a></p><!-- kjdhjhgdgldjhgdwtoiewotwotjdfkjdfffsf -->

If you are interested in my work, and would like to reach out<!-- slightdelayhere-->, feel free to send me an email at <!-- longlonglongcomment --><a href=>tyler@kruerindustries.org</a>.

<p>Thank you for checking this page out : )</p>
